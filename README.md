# ReduxCart
## Redux cart is an application, where you can add and delete items from cart. 
## IT uses redux and the firebase to manage the products in the cart. 

## while building this app I used thunks, and a lot of redux toolkit. Also i learned where to put asnychronus code, and how to deal with fetching, and sending data to database. In real projects, you would probably use some nodejs with mongodb or next with prisma but here my goal was to get familiar with ```redux``` And this is very good tool to develop apps.
